Computer vision has a wide variety of applications not only to reduce the human effort but also used for entertainment apps.


Using Opencv in python, 5 lines of code are sufficient to create a beautiful pencil sketch of an image:

2. Create its negative
3. Remove noise using Gaussian filter
4. Apply the tricky dodging and burning technique
